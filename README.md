# FinalProject
The project aims at implementing a system to map the liver fat using MRI DICOM Images
and generating the study based on the liver fat present in the patient. The doctor has to
load the corresponding in-phase and the out-phase images of the patient into the viewer.
The doctor can study the images and all the meta data will be displayed in the UI. The
doctor can select the ROI from the image and the program will calculate the fat fraction
based on the ROI selected by the doctor. The doctor can take as many ROIs and the
fat fraction mean will be generated correspondingly. The doctor can then save the study
which will be saved in the program.
